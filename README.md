# warehouse-monitoring-system
Warehouse Monitoring System is a hardware project that we as a team designed for our Sem 6 Sensor Lab Project..

Problem Statement and Objectives
The aim of this project is to design a system that has the ability to act as a low cost wireless sensor which detects the temperature and humidity in warehouses, the system should constantly keep a track of the humidity and temperature, and alert the owners in case the values cross a certain threshold to avoid the spoilage of food grains.

The objectives of this project are:
•	To design a model that can consistently and accurately detect fluctuations in temperature and humidity.
•	To display the current humidity and temperature levels to the users.
•	To alert stakeholders in case the humidity and temperature cross a certain threshold.
•	To prevent grains and food items from spoiling due to changes in moisture levels.

Proposed Solution
A system is necessary to monitor the temperature and humidity of the warehouse continuously. If the temperature or humidity exceeds a specific threshold, the system will alert the warehouse supervisor with the help of a buzzer and LED lights. Appropriate measures can then be taken to prevent damage to grains.
